    <p class="text">Reminder to self: the cure for writer's block is to flush your brain out with a flood of imput. Creativity is not some ephemeral magic. Creativity is a place in your mind where you dont feel ashamed and you have plenty of references. You need to keep the well of inspiration topped up, and the best thigns to put into it are things that look just like what you want to get out of it. </p>

<h3 class="titles">My favorite movie:</h3>

<img src="subjects/memento.jpg">
<p class="longtext">Mememnto was a powerful influence on me creativly and ideologically. The first half of the movie is in black and white, and the second half is in color. What makes this movie so unique and inspiring is that the two halves are interwoven, and the color scenes are played in reverse chronological order. The big reveal, the last scene that you see, is actually the middle of the film.  Memento taught me to look for assumptions that I didn't know I was making, like for example, that stories go from beginning to middle, to a climatic ending. </p>

            <p class="longtext">This is the fifteenth studio album from The Mountain Goats. At first listen, the album seems to be a love letter to professional wrestling. The conent of the lyrics certainly seems to suggest so. Fairly quickly, the deeper themes of death, hero worship, and ambition become too obvious to ignore. This album is a constant reminder that everything has a symbolic level that serves as a lense to better understand the world through. It helps that I've had deep love and appreciation for pro-wrestling since I was five.</p>

            <img src="assets/Inspo/monsters.webp" alt="">
            <p class="longtext">Written by Chuck Palahniuk (author of <i>Fight Club</i>) Invisible Monsters is a brutal, nauseating, and beautifully written story about a gorgeous supermodel that gets disfigured in a car accident. This book is a constant reminder that sometimes the things that hold you back are going to be woven into the very foundations of you. Eventually, you will have to mourn your past self as you redfine the very fundamentals of what you are. Caution: people at Palahniuk's live reading of one of his other works(the aptly titled <i>Guts</i>) have been known to faint. Consider this a warning.
